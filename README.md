# GeoJSON Validator

Here's a quick and reliable **JavaScript script** I put together for **validating GeoJSON data**. It's essential for ensuring your geospatial data is correctly structured before processing or displaying it.

This script performs checks for:
* Basic object structure
* Presence of `type` and `features` properties
* Correct `type` as `FeatureCollection`
* `features` being an array
* Each feature having `type`, `geometry`, and `properties`

Let me know your thoughts or how you handle GeoJSON validation!
